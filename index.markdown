# Registration now open

<blockquote>Imagine yourself and a posse of like-minded ruby hackers on a country retreat with zero internet for a weekend of fun. You'll laugh, hack, learn, cry (well, you probably won’t cry… but you know… it felt poetic) and most likely play a crap-load of guitar hero. [<a href="http://railscamp08.org/" title="Rails Camps">manifesto</a>]</blockquote>

## Buses from Gold Coast

We're aiming on organising a bus transfer from Gold Coast airport at 3:30pm, and returning to Gold Coast airport at 10am on Monday morning.

Its estimated the cost for the bus will be $45 or so. When final numbers are known, a final price will be set and money collected for this at that time.

So, if you want the bus choose the appropriate registration ticket to indicate this to our statisticians.

We can also plan that the bus does a pickup from he centre of Surfers Paradise if people want to arrive early on the Friday and do some sight seeing... Jump on the [RailsCamp mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/railscamp) to discuss this.
