# Registration now open

The venue we are booking has capacity for up to 150 people, we will   
have a separate dining  hall and multiple smaller areas for chillout/ 
Werewolf/Guitar hero/etc.

The venue is also fully catered and we will have three hot cooked   
meals per day (including Friday night & Monday morning). We will NOT be responsible for 
packing/unpacking this and general clean up. Nor cleaning up on Monday.

The cost per person is $164 - regardless if you want a dorm bed or want to share a tent. 

The final cleanup on the Monday is included so we do not need to clean
up before leaving.

## Buses from Brisbane

We're aiming on organising a bus transfer from Gold Coast airport at 3:30pm, and 
returning to Gold Coast airport at 10am on Monday morning.

Its estimated the cost for the bus will be $45 or so. When final numbers are known,
a final price will be set and money collected for this at that time.

So, if you want the bus choose the appropriate registration ticket to indicate this
to our statisticians.

We can also plan that the bus does a pickup from he   
centre of Surfers Paradise if people want to arrive early on the   
Friday and do some sight seeing... Jump on the [RailsCamp mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/railscamp) to discuss this.
