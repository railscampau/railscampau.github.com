In 3 months time is the 5th RailsCamp in Australia. This year it is hosted by the [good people](http://railscampau.github.com/organisers.html) in Brisbane and the Gold Coast, and will be held at [Koonjewarre Retreat Centre](http://www.koonjewarre.com/index.html), Gold Coast Hinterland, Queensland.

The dates are the 15th to the 18th of May, and all tickets are $164. There will be a bus from the Gold Coast Airport to the venue with the ticket price to be finalised when we know numbers. So pick the "bus" or "no bus" ticket that you need. We'll ask for the ~$45 for the bus when we have final amounts.

See you on the Gold Coast!
